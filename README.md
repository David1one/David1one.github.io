## My Github page:
### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm David McMahon. I'm a physics undergraduate, and I code quite heavily as part of that, primarily with Python.

I'm currently a member of the Biophotonics@Tyndall team at the Tyndall National Institute - please check them out.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Raspberry Pi, and I'm hoping to have enough experience to help mentor the ninjas at Coderdojo Bishopstown once we reopen. I'm open to any projects suggestions I could bring them through to introduce the machine to them.

<!---You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/David1one/David1one.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/David1one/David1one.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
